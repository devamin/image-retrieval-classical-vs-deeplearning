In this notebook I tried to compare classical methods of Image retrieval with Deep learning representation : 
- Histogram color
- Harlick
- LBP
- Hog Descriptor
- Bag Of Visual Words
    - Histogram
    - LBP 
    - HOG
- Pretrained deeplearning model Resnet


Permformance is mesured using mAP and execution time.
